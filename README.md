# Decentralised Exchange Backend

A fully functional DEX backend built with SafeMath and unit tested against multiple ERC20 token mocks. The exchange utilises the Bubble Sort algorithm to arrange prices according to the position taken (buy/sell).

Users may deposit ERC-20 tokens into their exchange wallet as long as the token address exists in the registry. For security reasons, token listing is restricted to only the administrator. Buy and sell orders for DAI or other stablecoins are also not permitted.

## Smart Contract Archive

Repositories with the -archive notation are practice projects to demonstrate my ability to write functional Solidity code with real world use cases. I also use these as educational material for some of the peer-to-peer mentorship I do on the side.
